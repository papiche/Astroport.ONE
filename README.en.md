# Preamble
Are you ready to be part of an exciting technological adventure? Do you want to contribute to an innovative project that aims to protect freedom of expression and promote uncensored information sharing? If so, Astroport is the perfect fit for you!

Astroport is much more than just software; it's a groundbreaking platform that leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) and IPFS technology to enable users to share information, particularly videos, securely and without fear of censorship. We are committed to defending freedom of expression and combating potential restrictions imposed by fact-checking laws advanced by the European Union.

But Astroport doesn't stop there. We go even further by creating a network that identifies resources around you, whether it's food, friends, services, or goods. Imagine being able to easily find what you need, locally and in a decentralized manner. With Astroport, you'll never be alone when it comes to meeting your needs.

Moreover, we offer a revolutionary tool called the "build guide," inspired by Minecraft but for real life. You'll be able to follow detailed tutorials to build or produce anything you desire. And to facilitate your projects, we've integrated the marketplace of the Äž1 libre currency (gchange.fr), allowing you to order the necessary basic materials for your creations.

To make all this possible, we need talented and passionate developers like you! Join our team and contribute to the creation of a revolutionary platform that unleashes the power of knowledge and fosters unhindered collaboration.

As a developer at Astroport, you'll have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies such as P2P, IPFS, and the Äž1 libre currency. You'll push the boundaries of innovation and contribute to a project that will change the way we share information and interact with our environment.

Join us now and be part of a passionate team working to make the world better, freer, and more connected. Together, we will build a future where censorship has no place and the sharing of knowledge becomes a reality for all.

Join Astroport and make a difference today!

With this technology, we each become host and provider, monetary and media sovereign.
With this technology, we establish the "Crypto Department 96" whose map connects territories beyond borders and countries.

Astroport ONE is the embassy of a world made of interconnected algorithmic webs of trust.

# Astroport.ONE

It is a life-size board game that consists in listing, inventing, teaching, and disseminating the best ways to inhabit the planet Earth.
This program introduces multimedia data (web page, audio, video) as data chains (blockchain) registered in the IPFS network
network that players exchange through TW and Oasis.

## Fred Story

In 2018, when most of my job oportunies were about Blockchain and IoT aiming to monitor anything... I understood that we should go with great advice in this new age. So.
I decided to refuse to have a profession to get â‚¬ to live, and thanks to the RSA, transformed my apartment in Toulouse into a "G1FabLab" to realize several prototypes and experiments around the use and practice of G1.

Several prototypes developed on small computers (RaspberryPi ZeroW, 3B and 4B) appeared.

We used the G1BILLET to discover that it is only a "bearer voucher written on paper" which, contrary to the habit to which the bank accustomed us, must be destroyed when it returns to its issuer.

When I launched the G1SMS service (to make payments between cell phone numbers), all this was working on a Raspberry Pi (without UPS) and a phone in my apartment located in Toulouse.

I became aware that I was becoming a "trusted third party" who had to guarantee the functioning of the service 24h/24. Becoming the manager of everyone's "login" and "keys", to make them "operate" through a software on a blockchain-type database confers a great responsibility!

The design of the software and the federative architecture that I had just experimented with used a wallet account to create the operator of the service, who then controlled the keys of other wallets and could take a share of each transaction that could be paid for each "branch".

And it is in front of this company that I wished to stop the G1SMS service.

Indeed, cryptography is an art that expressed in the cyberspace provides powers, the one to send "registered mails unreadable except by the public key that has been used as address", the one where having a private key offers a "safe" for each one. A new "cryptopunk" world is revealed... A place where a crazy race takes place between those who imagine the best encryption (to maintain their secret activity? or their private life?) and those who wish to break this encryption (for? many reasons surely?).

Finally, behind the advantageous action of making all our usernames and passwords disappear, another game is actually hidden. The one that links our accounts. Our Avatar and the UNiverse where it is delivered is composed of chains and keys... Of contracts?!

With G1SMS, and the exploration of the G1, I had put my finger on the role of the Trusted Third Party, who puts himself forward and offers his services. And this was the job of the Banker, the Insurer too... And finally that of the State since it imposes the currency of the game to the players and issues your identity card.

These structures were not invented by us. They are constantly discussed, remodeled, imposing laws to make up for a lack of rules that cannot be respected by all. This is a difficult challenge, especially when one can have multiple identities.

For practical reasons, we will delegate our trust. And from now on, in these times, our encryption keys. Certified by the issuer of the tokens of the game that became software. The set of keys that will make our future software work, depends on what we do with them. The entire Internet is being redesigned.

So with some friends at RSA, we have undertaken this journey into the future of JUNE, an imagined country. A Game capable of organizing a commune. 100% FREE. The one where our keys belong to us!

Stopped by the authorities. We were able to build in the forest, as an extension to the models of self-built autonomous habitats explored by the "MadeInZion" foundation, the prototype of a decentralized Internet "SolarPunk" that can work OnLine and OffLine.


Personally this exploration will have allowed me to understand and to deconstruct the contracts linking "Fred" and/or "FrÃ©dÃ©ric RENAULT" to the board game. To discover the Administrative Inquisition, the harassments undergone by "FrÃ©dÃ©ric RENAULT", until inflicting to this "player" one of the "legal entities" of the chain of parental authority that I had just broken, the prohibition to meet neither Emma, nor Tim if they were called "RENAULT--PREVOST". What he testified he did not wish to wear during our meetings. It was enough to vaporize the injunctions towards my person.

A sacred adventure! Where my national identity card and my key member of the June face each other. Where the CAF claims the reimbursement of the RSA. Where my bank account is blocked next month... I know I am curious. Curious to understand the world I live in.

At this point, I might as well continue.

By pooling our computers with the right free software, We can become together a datacenter without any address, that stores and shares our data "with each other".

ðŸ¥¥ A Free Internet. Why? How? With whom?

The keys of modern encryption (remember ed25519) lead to the same place, a decimal sequence located in the decimals of "Ï€". It is in this great infinite spiral that our data are installed. And it is in this circle that our keys define sequences that serve as keys (that we link to other keys)

With @aya the creator of Olympe Network, we are aware of this mutation. We have invested in IPFS, the global disk where everything we write on it is readable by everyone, provided that he has the keys to dispose of it.

From this association has just been born "THE â™¥BOX", a software and network service that allows you to save your favorite "Youtube" channel or playlist. All these data are saved in "The Claude", a hybrid software using our keys so we can host and own the data we publish.
