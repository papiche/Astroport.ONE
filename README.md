# Astroport.ONE: Your Decentralized Portal to a New Digital Frontier

[FR](README.fr.md) - [ES](README.es.md)

**Welcome to Astroport.ONE!** Imagine a digital world where you are in control, where data is secure, payments are seamless, and community thrives beyond borders. Astroport.ONE is building this future, and you are invited to be a part of it.

## üåç What is Astroport.ONE?

Astroport.ONE is a revolutionary platform designed to empower individuals and communities in the Web3 era. It's more than just software; it's a toolkit for creating your own decentralized digital embassy - a **Station** - where you can manage your digital identity, participate in a decentralized economy using the ƒû1 (June) cryptocurrency, and contribute to a global network of interconnected stations.

**Think of Astroport.ONE as:**

*   **Your Personal Data Haven:** Store and manage your data securely thanks to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), ensuring it is censorship-resistant and always accessible.
*   **A Commission-Free Payment System:** Use the ƒû1 (June) cryptocurrency for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries or fees, fostering a fair and equitable economy.
*   **A Digital Community Builder:** Connect with other Astroport.ONE Stations and users worldwide, sharing information, resources, and building trust-based networks.
*   **A "Construction Guide" for the Decentralized Web:** Leverage our open-source tools and software to create and deploy your own Web3 applications and services.

## üöÄ The UPlanet Ecosystem: Two Levels of Digital Sovereignty

Astroport.ONE powers the **UPlanet ecosystem**, which operates on two distinct levels with different capabilities and security requirements:

### üåê **UPlanet ORIGIN (EnfinLibre)**

- **Token Value**: Customizable based on community needs (technically still 0.1 ƒû1)

#### **ZEN Economy Stable COIN System**

UPlanet ·∫êen operates as a **Stable COIN system** that can work with **any asset class** while maintaining proper value equity:

| **Asset Class** | **ZEN Representation** | **Example Community** |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Fiat Currencies** | 1 ·∫êen = 1‚Ç¨, 1$, 1¬• | Local Economy Networks |
| **Real Estate** | 1 ·∫êen = 1m¬≤ land | Property Investment Groups |
| **Commodities** | 1 ·∫êen = 1kg gold/silver | Precious Metals Collectives |
| **DeFi Tokens** | 1 ·∫êen = 1 USDC/DAI | DeFi Integration Networks |
| **Energy Credits** | 1 ·∫êen = 1 kWh | Renewable Energy Communities |
| **Carbon Credits** | 1 ·∫êen = 1 ton CO2 | Environmental Conservation Groups |

## Essential Features: The Power of Astroport.ONE

*   **ZenCard and AstroID: Your Access Keys**

    *   **ZenCard**: An innovative payment system based on the simplicity and security of QR Codes.
    *   **AstroID**: Your digital identity, inviolable and under your complete control.

*   **Decentralized and Organized Storage**

    *   **IPFS at its Core**: Benefit from distributed storage, resistant to censorship and centralized failures.
    *   **MBR and Allocation Table**: A Tiddlywiki data organization optimized for performance and reliability.

*   **V≈ìux: The Keywords that Animate AstroBot**

    *   **V≈ìux System**: More than just wishes, "V≈ìux" (Vows) are keywords that *you* define in your TiddlyWiki to trigger **AstroBot**, the automated heart of Astroport.ONE. These keywords activate BASH programs, rudimentary smart contracts, that allow you to automate actions, synchronize data, or perform specific tasks within your station. While V≈ìux can be supported by donations in the ƒû1 free currency, their primary function is to orchestrate automation via AstroBOT, not collaborative funding.

*   **Synchronization and P2P Communication**

    *   **Astroport.ONE Stations**: Your station communicates and synchronizes with a network of digital embassies, ensuring maximum data consistency and availability.
    *   **AstroBot: Intelligence Serving Your Data**: A system of smart contracts in BASH, reacting to events on the ƒû1 network and to "V≈ìux" to automate and optimize your experience.
    *   **G1PalPay.sh: The ƒû1 Transaction Monitor**: A crucial script that monitors the ƒû1 blockchain in real-time. It allows Astroport.ONE to react to transactions, execute commands based on transaction comments, and manage financial flows within the ecosystem.

## **Who is Astroport.ONE For?**

*   **Individuals seeking digital sovereignty:** Take back control of your data and your online presence.
*   **Communities building decentralized solutions:** Create and manage shared resources and collaborative projects.
*   **Developers and innovators:** Explore the potential of Web3 and build decentralized applications on a robust platform.
*   **Users of the ƒû1 (June) cryptocurrency:** Enhance your ƒû1 experience with secure payments and a thriving ecosystem.
*   **Anyone interested in a freer, safer, and more interconnected digital world.**

## **Get Started with Astroport.ONE:**

**Installation (Linux - Debian/Ubuntu/Mint):**

Setting up your Astroport.ONE Station is easy thanks to our automated installation script:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://install.astroport.com)
```

### Running Processes

After installation, you should find the following processes running:

```
