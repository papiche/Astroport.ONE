Of course. The current README is very dense and technically focused. It's excellent as a specification sheet but can be overwhelming for a newcomer. The key is to transform it from a "What it is" document into a "Why it matters and how you can join" guide.

The most crucial change is to **center the entire narrative around the cooperative model**. Astroport.ONE isn't just a piece of software; it's the tool to build a new kind of digital economy.

Here is a proposed rewrite of the README.md. It simplifies the concepts, clarifies the user journey, and puts the cooperative vision front and center.

# Astroport.ONE: Building a Cooperative Internet

[FR](README.fr.md) - [ES](README.es.md)

**The internet was meant to be a tool for liberation. Instead, we became its product.** Our data is monetized, our communities are fragmented, and our digital lives are owned by a handful of giant corporations.

**Astroport.ONE is a declaration of digital independence.** It's not just another platform; it's a suite of open-source tools and a social contract designed to help individuals and communities build a Web3 ecosystem they truly own.

Powered by the **[CopyLaRadio](https://copylaradio.com) Cooperative**, our mission is to transform users from digital tenants into sovereign co-owners of their infrastructure.

## 🌍 What is Astroport.ONE?

Astroport.ONE is the open-source software that allows you to run your own personal server—a **Station**. Think of it as your digital embassy on a new, decentralized frontier.

With your Station, you can:
*   ✊ **Own Your Data:** Store your files on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), making them resistant to censorship and corporate control.
*   💬 **Communicate Freely:** Connect to the decentralized social network NOSTR, safe from algorithms and arbitrary bans.
*   💰 **Build a Real Economy:** Use the Ğ1 (June) free currency and our internal Ẑen accounting system to create value and exchange it fairly.

## 🌱 The Cooperative Economic Model: From Users to Owners

This isn't just about technology. It's about building a sustainable, cooperative economy. The legal and social backbone of our project is the **[CopyLaRadio](https://www.copylaradio.com) SCIC**, a French cooperative society.

Our model is simple: **we turn the cost of infrastructure into shared capital.**
*   **The Ẑen (Ẑ):** To manage our projects, we use an internal, stable accounting unit called the Ẑen. Within our cooperative, **1 Ẑen = 1€**. It allows us to transparently manage our assets (servers, domains, etc.) and our expenses.
*   **Shared Ownership:** When you contribute to the cooperative, you're not just "paying for a service." You are buying parts of the shared infrastructure, becoming a co-owner of the servers, and investing in our collective future—including real-world assets like forests.

## A Tale of Two Worlds: UPlanet ORIGIN vs. UPlanet Ẑen

The UPlanet ecosystem has two interconnected "realms" designed for different purposes.

| Feature | **UPlanet ORIGIN (The Public Gateway)** | ✅ **UPlanet Ẑen (The Cooperative Network)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | **Discovery & Onboarding.** A "bac à sable" to test the tech. | **Building & Economy.** The real, value-driven cooperative space. |
| **Access** | Open to everyone with an email or Ğ1 account. | Reserved for **cooperative members** (ZENCARD & Captains). |
| **Value of Ẑen**| 1 Ẑen = 0.1 Ğ1 (an internal play-money). | **1 Ẑen = 1€** (a stable unit for our real economy). |
| **Confiance**| Basic identity verification. | Based on the Ğ1 **Web of Trust** and the legal cooperative pact. |
| **Identity** | Basic MULTIPASS. | **Validated uPASSPORT**, your certificate of co-ownership. |
